- Meetup
-- C++ DNN algorithm, another algorithm is OpenCV - opencv4nodejs
-- What the package finds:
--- it detects faces, and gives a bounding box of where the face is
--- it gives you the most likely match and a percentage of likelyhood
- We are going to use a library called FaceRecognition
- you need to use a package called dlib

- First you detect faces
-- it extracts those detected faces, and allows you to store those detected faces
- You first locate faces, then detect faces
- He was using graphic magic to draw the detected face squares on an image

- Recognition
-- you train the model by calling faceRecognizer.addFace(faceImage, personName)
-- once it has read all of the image files then you can save that model state
--- you can save the state as a string of binary data

- Prediction
-- you call recognizer.Predict(image),

Assignment
- Draw rectangles with the matching person name underneath

How hard was it to get dlib setup?

- How did I get this working?
-- NOTE: I already had XCode installed, which is used by this in some way
-- first I installed GraphicsMagic
--- brew install graphicsmagick
-- then I installed cmake
--- brew install cmake
-- Then installed the face-detection npm pacakge, this appears to have built dlib
--- npm install --save face-recognition
--- npm install --save gm
